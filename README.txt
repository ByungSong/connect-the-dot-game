How to start the node server

1. Download all the files from https://github.com/ByungSong/connect-the-dot-game.
2. In the downloaded folder terminal, type "node install" which will install all the required libraries.
3. Start the node server by typing "nodemon ws.js" in. the terminal
4. Once node server is up and running, click on the index.html to play the game. 

Note.
I was able to start the Node server using WebSocket API and connect the dots and couldn't get others things done. 
Thank for reviewing!
